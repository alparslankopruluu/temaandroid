<!-- app-factory shared router. Keep under 150 lines; load detailed docs JIT. -->

## 0. Verify instructions

Before code changes, read `PRODUCT.md` and `docs/stack.md`, then state
`Instructions verified.` If either is missing/unfilled, use `/new-app` for a blank
product or `/continue-app` for an established repository. Begin a nontrivial session with
`factoryctl session start` and close it with `factoryctl session finish` (it flags code changes
that skip `docs/features.md`/`README.md`); when unsure, use `/guide` rather than guessing.

**Kit-root exception:** when `install.sh`, `docs/stack/swiftui.md`, and
`docs/stack/expo-rn.md` exist, read template `PRODUCT.md` plus both stack documents.
Placeholders are expected; never run `/new-app` in the kit root. Here `README.md`
owns current capabilities, `FUTURE-DASHBOARD.md` deferred product work, and git plus
`KIT_VERSION` release history.

## 2. Scope and approvals

1. Work only in the current `docs/mvp-plan.md` milestone; put new ideas in
   `docs/backlog.md`.
2. New dependency, screen, or Firestore collection needs explicit approval.
3. Update the canonical owner immediately; do not copy facts across memory docs.
4. An approved `/factory-run` blueprint authorizes only its stated scope/dependencies/
   external writes. Unexpected or destructive diffs still stop.
5. Never ask users to choose a skill. Ask only for a product-direction, protected-file,
   cost, or external-write decision that changes authority.

## 3. Context router

For nontrivial work run `factoryctl context route --intent-stdin` first. It projects the
smallest matching capability using stack, stage, health, availability, and lexical score;
load that capability's playbook, tools, and skill only after selection. High confidence
selects automatically; low confidence gives the lead the three compact candidates for a
semantic choice. Do not load the full catalog or installed-extras list into agent context.

Then use `factoryctl context prepare` before handoff/checkpoint and `context audit` before
continuation. Read `docs/playbooks/context-engineering.md` for the capsule/receipt contract.
To find the right playbook/checklist for a question, run
`factoryctl knowledge search --query "<question>"` against `docs/knowledge-index.json`
(regenerate with `knowledge index`); inspect skill coverage with `factoryctl skills list|health`.
Use goal + relevant context + constraints + evidence + success criteria; increase reasoning
only when measured work needs it. Harness-injected tool schemas are opaque overhead: report
them when measurable, never claim they were removed. Do not add embedding, vector DB, or RAG.
For agent switches or malformed/stale packets use `factoryctl harness inspect|render|validate`
and the `harness-health` capability. Unknown fields fail closed; regenerate a malformed or
stale contract with a fresh capsule. Never retry a protected or external mutation.

If routing confidence is low, use the `external-skill-discovery` fallback and
`docs/playbooks/skill-discovery.md`; show at most three inspected candidates and install only
after exact source/skill/destination approval. When the user asks what the kit can do, what
comes next, or to open Factory Status, refresh compact recommendations and open
`scripts/open-factory-status.command --background --capabilities` without requiring a
command or skill name.

## 4. Non-negotiable safety

No hardcoded UI strings; secrets/logged keys/committed `.env*`; world-writable Firestore;
callables without App Check; purchase logic outside the RevenueCat wrapper; UI-thread I/O;
unvirtualized long lists; committed `console.log`/`print`; unsafe unwraps; raw screen colors/
spacing; duplicate helpers; `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; blind create retries; automatic
deletion, DerivedData cleanup, bare `firebase deploy`, review submission, deceptive promotion,
fake reviews, planted/seeded comments, incentivized reviews, purchased
engagement/followers, spam, or engagement manipulation.

Protected files require explicit approval: security rules, RevenueCat wrapper, app entry/root
layout, `.env*`/credentials/config, the Scope Fence, production deletion, billing links, and
App Store review submission.

These rules are mechanically backed by `.claude/settings.json` deny/ask lists and the
`scripts/hooks/` guards — see "Deterministic guards" in `docs/security-model.md`.

## 5. State, evidence, and handoff

`.factory/context/` is local, ignored, secret-free, `0600` state: a capsule binds task, repo
fingerprint, allowed paths, acceptance, approvals, references, and exact next action. Stale
HEAD/working tree, a missing heading, or hash mismatch blocks resume; handoff carries only the
short redacted bootstrap, never `.factory` or private context. Android's `task done` needs
recorded evidence, not a receipt.

When the harness exposes subagents you are the orchestrator: planning, architecture, scope, task
dispatch, and final review stay with you, and bounded implementation/research/mechanical work is
dispatched to workers by effort — self for trivial, at most three independent ordinary workers,
and the provider-adaptive 8-concurrent/20-total policy only for an explicit dynamic workflow
(`dynamic-workflows.md`), with isolated worktrees for parallel writers. Never do bounded work
serially when it can be delegated, and never let a worker accept its own work: review diff,
receipt, evidence, and scope. `model-routing.md` owns tier/effort policy. Never delegate
protected files, secrets, external writes, spend, acceptance, or serial semantic decisions.

For v2 tasks: `task submit TASK_ID --receipt PATH`, `receipt validate PATH`, then lead
`task accept TASK_ID` or `task reject TASK_ID --reason "..."`. `task done` cannot claim
success without accepted evidence. Blueprint approval is separately digested and is invalid
when identifier, price, environment, or mutation scope changes.

## 6. Gates and canonical docs

Pre-change: current milestone, minimal files, i18n, relevant JIT docs. Post-change: targeted
lint/build/typecheck/tests, no forbidden pattern, analytics for new screens, register each new
screen/feature in `docs/features.md` (`factoryctl features add`) and keep `README.md` current,
canonical-doc update, applicable performance review, then `factoryctl recommend refresh` at
checkpoints.

`PRODUCT.md` owns what/why; `mvp-plan.md` current work; `features.md` shipped work;
`backlog.md` later; `product-map.md` journeys; `growth-plan.md` experiments;
`security-model.md` threats; `stack.md` toolchain; `architecture.md` structure;
`decisions.md` rationale; `README.md` entry point. Resolve ambiguity in that order, then an
existing similar implementation, matching playbook, or ask the user.
